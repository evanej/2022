## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
packages <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "arules", "arulesviz", "datasets", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "TH.data",
              "ISLR2", "lattice", "stats", "rattle", "RColorBrewer", "caret", "ROCR", "cluster", "gridExtra", "factoextra",
              "NbClust", "dendextend", "fpc", "reshape", "purrr", "igraph", "readxl", "httr", "usamap")
for(pkg in packages){
  install.packages(pkg)
}



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
